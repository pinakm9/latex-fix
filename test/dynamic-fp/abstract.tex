First we show that physics-informed neural networks are not suitable for a large class of parabolic partial differential equations including the Fokker-Planck equation. Then we devise an algorithm to compute solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation using the zeros of Fokker-Planck operator and the Feynman-Kac formula. The resulting algorithm is mesh-free, highly parallelizable and able to compute solutions pointwise, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality in a practical sense. We analyze various nuances of this algorithm that are determined by the drift term in the Fokker-Planck equation. We work with problems ranging in dimensions from 2 to 10. We demonstrate that this algorithm requires orders of magnitude fewer trajectories for each point in space when compared to Monte-Carlo. We also prove that under suitable conditions the error caused by letting some trajectories associated with the Feynman-Kac expectation, escape our domain of knowledge is proportional to the fraction of trajectories that escape.
