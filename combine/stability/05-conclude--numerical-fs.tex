The main focus of this study was to develop a novel methodology to assess nonlinear filter stability using recently introduced techniques for calculating Wasserstein distances between distributions. We show that the particle filter and ensemble Kalman filter are stable when applied to a wide range of chaotic, deterministic dynamical systems, but the EnKF fails to capture the true filtering distribution.

We expect that the use of numerical algorithms for computing distances between the distributions will be a powerful tool for understanding nonlinear filters, leading to several avenues for further exploration. One direction of particular interest in earth sciences is to examine the relation between filter stability and the dynamical properties of the systems being observed.
